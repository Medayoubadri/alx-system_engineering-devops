# 0x07. Networking Basics #0

## Project Overview
This project introduces fundamental networking concepts that are essential for understanding how computers communicate over networks. The focus is on the OSI model, IP and MAC addresses, and the differences between TCP and UDP protocols.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the **OSI model** and its layers.
- Differentiate between **TCP** and **UDP** protocols.
- Learn about **MAC and IP addresses** and their roles in networking.
- Familiarize with **types of networks** like LAN, WAN, and the Internet.

## Tasks Summary
1. **OSI Model**  
   - Explain what the OSI model is and how itâ€™s structured.
   
2. **Types of Network**  
   - Identify the type of network for different scenarios, such as LAN, WAN, and the Internet.
   
3. **MAC and IP Address**  
   - Understand the purpose of MAC addresses as unique identifiers for network interfaces and how IP addresses function similarly to postal addresses.

4. **UDP and TCP**  
   - Describe the characteristics of TCP (reliable, slower) and UDP (fast, but may lose data).

5. **TCP and UDP Ports**  
   - Write a script to display the PID and program names for all listening TCP and UDP ports.
   
6. **Is the Host on the Network**  
   - Write a script that pings an IP address to check if it is reachable on the network.

## Usage and Examples
- Each task file contains clear instructions, explanations, and example usage.
- Ensure all Bash scripts are executable and follow `shellcheck` standards.

## Fun Facts
- Did you know that the first computers were called "mainframes" because they were used to store and process data on large-scale systems?
- The Internet was invented by **Vint Cerf** in 1969.
- The Internet is the largest network in the world, with over **1.3 billion** active users.
- The Internet is composed of **two** main protocols: TCP and UDP.
- The Internet is a **global network** that connects computers and devices around the world.
- The Internet is **asynchronous** and **unreliable**, meaning that packets may take different routes to reach their destination.
- The Internet is **decentralized**, meaning that there is no central authority controlling it.

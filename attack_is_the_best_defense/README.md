# Attack is the Best Defense

This project is part of the ALX System Engineering & DevOps curriculum. It focuses on network security, specifically ARP spoofing, network sniffing, and dictionary attacks.

## Project Description

This project consists of two main tasks:

1. ARP spoofing and sniffing unencrypted traffic
2. Dictionary attack

### Task 0: ARP spoofing and sniffing unencrypted traffic

In this task, we use `tcpdump` to capture network traffic and analyze it to find a password in a provided script.

### Task 1: Dictionary attack

This task involves using Hydra to perform a dictionary attack on an SSH server running in a Docker container.
